- 👋 Hi, I’m Mika.
- 👀 I’m learning how to become a Fullstack Ruby on Rails developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming and working on basic projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript.I will start using Ruby in September 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate around October 2021 when I feel I've learnt enough on my own to work with others.
- 📫 You can contact me on my email mikachiusiwa@gmail.com

I'm gonna code my very own learning blog soon! I will post my progress there.
