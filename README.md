- Hi, Iâ€™m Mika.
- Iâ€™m learning how to become a Software developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of programming and working on basic projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript.I have also started learning Ruby as of October 2021.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate around July 2022 when I feel I've learnt enough on my own to work with others.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me on my email mikachiusiwa@gmail.com

I'm gonna code my very own learning blog soon! I will post my progress there.
