Hi, I’m Mika and I’m learning software development.
Specific technologies/concepts I'm learning and/or interesting in using within 2022 are:

-Javascript, HTML/CSS, React.js, MongoDB, Ruby on Rails, CI/CD, AWS, Docker, Node.js, Express.js, and so much more.


I hope to code my very own learning blog to post interesting things I learn. Thanks for reading.
