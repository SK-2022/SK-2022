Hi, I’m Mika and I’m a Software Engineer in Japan.
Specific technologies/concepts I'm currently learning and/or interested in are:

-Javascript, HTML/CSS, React.js, MongoDB, Ruby, CI/CD, AWS, Docker, Node.js, Express.js, and so much more.


I hope to code my very own learning blog to post interesting things I learn. Thanks for reading.
